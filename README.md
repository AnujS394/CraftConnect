## 🏷️ Hackathon Details

- **Team Name:** FarmHouse
- **Theme:** Build for Rural India  
- **Domain:** Livelihoods & Inclusion

- **Challenge Statement:** Making E-Commerce Accessible for Rural Artisans Using AI

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Millions of rural artisans in India create high-quality handmade products but struggle to earn a fair income due to:

- Dependence on middlemen (80–90% profit loss)
- Low digital literacy and English-only platforms
- Inability to create professional product listings
- Poor product images and no pricing guidance

As a result, over **200+ million artisans** remain digitally excluded, earning below the poverty line despite high skill levels.

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

**CraftConnect** removes these barriers through **voice-first AI automation**:

- Artisans speak in their **own language**
- Upload **one photo + voice description**
- AI generates:
  - SEO-ready product titles & descriptions
  - Enhanced, professional product images
  - Fair price recommendations
- Products go live in minutes — **no typing, no English, no middlemen**

---

## 🔁 Conceptual Workflow (Artisan Upload)

1. Artisan opens app and speaks: *“Upload new product”*
2. Takes a single photo of the product
3. AI enhances the image (background removal, clarity)
4. Artisan gives short voice description
5. AI generates:
   - Product title
   - Detailed description
   - Tags & translations
6. Add Pricing
7. Voice confirmation → product goes live
